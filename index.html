This site hosts Twitter data related to COVID-19 (Coronavirus). We distribute this Twitter data to support
research efforts in the fight against COVID-19.

The dataset contains Twitter ids, from which you can download the original data directly from Twitter.
Additionally, we include the date, keywords related to COVID-19 and the inferred geolocation.
Our hope is that this information will support researchers conducting different types of analyses,
especially those with a geographic component.

We will continue to update the dataset throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
